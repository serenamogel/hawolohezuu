Of course, his grandfather was a Yakuza crime boss who had a contract with a Zombie Devil and killed Denji, but he disregarded that and attacked the team, using his terrifying speed and powerful blades. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aki uses his Curse Devil sword</a>, but that‚Äôs not even enough to stop him and Himeno is forced to use the Ghost Devil to hold him back. She seems to be winning, until <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Akane</a> arrives with her Snake Devil, chomps the Ghost Devil, and causes Himeno to disappear.</p><p data-characters=604 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>Around Tokyo, things aren‚Äôt getting much better. People are going around shooting other people as if they‚Äôve been possessed by the Gun Devil, the main bad force Special Division 4 has been trying to find and destroy. Aki theorizes this is the case because only police officers and Public Safety Devil Hunters are allowed to carry guns in Tokyo. The devil hunters Arai and Kobeni are still processing their actions after their poor performance at the Hotel Morin where the Eternity Devil made them lose their wits and they turned against Denji, offering him Denji to escape that eternal place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=in dir=ltr>Kobeni off duty ü•π‚ú® <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UwbxTD8xGP</a></p>‚Äî Chainsaw Man EN (@Chainsaw_EN) <a href=#>November 24, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>As Arai and Kobeni walk around the city, an old woman passes them. The old woman turns around and shoots Arai in the back of the neck, then purposely gets in front of Kobeni and takes a gunshot to the head. This kills Arai and Kobeni is devastated by this, but her pain turns into vengeance.</p><p data-characters=639 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>Kobeni approaches Akane and Katana Man who have just defeated Denji. Kobeni figures out that they were the ones responsible for all these deaths, and she brandishes a knife, and with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Makima using an outrageously powerful long-range attack</a>, the two are very vulnerable. Akane summons the Snake Tail and the tail whips itself at Kobeni who gets on top of it and runs across it with speedy grace. Katana Man in his human form tries to shoot her, but she dodges the bullets and cuts off his arm. She takes his gun and fires back at him. Akane fires back and she uses Chainsaw Man as a shield, firing at their getaway vehicle as they drive off.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Kobeni falls to her knees holding Chainsaw Man and admits that this is her fault and that she can‚Äôt do this job because it will drive her nuts. She says she‚Äôll tell Himeno that she‚Äôs quitting, but little does she know that Himeno is also dead.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=false>Although Kobeni believes that this is all too much for her, she really shows what she can do in this episode. She held her own against two very powerful characters and sent them running away. If she decides to stay, she could really be of use to the Public Safety Devil Hunters, and it could be a way for her to avenge her friend Arai.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6apaismJq%2FbrnAo6arZZOdrrOtwq2cq2WYlsBusMiem2ahnmKwqa3Ip6qar12irq95xKmgrKeUmnp6ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelen-coleman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelen Coleman Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chocolate-chip-pumpkin-bread-recipe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread - Mom On Timeout</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
