Ethnicity, Nationality, Family</span></h2><p><strong>Biniyam Shibre,</strong> born in 1991, will be 29 years old in late Spring 2020. Furthermore, the Ethiopian hunk celebrated his birthday on April 6th. Biniyam inherited traits like ambition and vigor from his Zodiac sign (Aries).</p><p>Shibre’s family was all from the beautiful country of Ethiopia. Biniyam, on the other hand, rarely showed off his parents and siblings on social media. However, this did not imply that she did not love and admire them.</p><p>Fans of “90 Day Fiance” assumed Biniyam’s father and mother supported his ambitions. Biniyam posted a photo of his late mother on Instagram in May 2020. According to the post, he lost his mother when he was a child.</p><h2><span id=Is_Biniyam_Shibre_Single_Relationship_Boyfriend>Is Biniyam Shibre Single? Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Biniyam Shibre met Ariela outside of a hotel taxi stop in Ethiopia in 2018. When asked about their first meeting, the American beauty revealed:</p><p><strong>“I was waiting for a taxi outside a nearby hotel when I noticed a very attractive man. I yelled, ‘Don’t I know you from somewhere?’ and it worked… “</strong></p><p>Biniyam initially rejected Ariel’s romantic advances. In the end, she succumbed to his enticing ways. Ariel became pregnant after three months of dating. The couple decided that the expecting mother should relocate to the United States for prenatal care.</p><p>When the time came for the couple to welcome their child, Biniyam persuaded Ariel to return to Ethiopia. While in the African country, Ariel expressed her concern about the country’s delivery of care. Furthermore, Ariel’s parents and siblings publicly opposed the international couple’s relationship. Biniyam, her sisters suspected, was using the aspiring writer to obtain a green card.</p><h2><span id=Biniyam_Shibre_Divorce_Ex-Wife_First_Son>Biniyam Shibre Divorce, Ex-Wife, First Son</span></h2><p>Shibre had done the same thing to another American woman before falling in love with Ariel and impregnating her. Biniyam and his now-unknown ex-wife welcomed a son in 2017. Simon was the name they gave to their bundle of joy. They had already married by that time.</p><p>Biniyam and his ex-wife were unhappy together even with Simon in the picture. As a result, they ended up divorcing one another. Despite his objections, Biniyam’s ex-wife moved to the United States with their son after they divorced. He took to Instagram after being unable to see his son and vowed to never forget his child.</p><p>Ariel, like Biniyam, had an unsuccessful marriage with her ex-husband Leandro. They divorced in 2018 after ten years of marriage.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Biniyam_Shibre_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Biniyam Shibre start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Biniyam Shibre, according to his Instagram bio, wore many hats. He worked as a <strong>dancer/choreographer</strong> in addition to being a martial artist and a gymnast. Furthermore, Biniyam from “90 Day Fiance” made a living as a physical trainer. Biniyam also performed in South Sudan as a performer. Similarly, he competed in a bodybuilding competition.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Biniyam_Shibre_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Biniyam Shibre?
