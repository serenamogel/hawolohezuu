She wrote, "Filming Curb Appeal Xtreme for @hgtv is an experience of a lifetime. I remember binge-watching HGTV 20 years ago, wondering how all those designers got to do what they love for a living AND on TV. Turns out, it takes a lot of hard work, bravery, sacrifice, and a stomach to take big risks...and dreaming to the extreme! My grandma used to say, be careful what you ask for, you just might get it. I got it."&nbsp;</p><p>'Curb Appeal Xtreme' premieres on September 8 on HGTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom6Wnr26tz6mcmqRdrcGzscyeZKGfpKt6r7HWZqqhp6dis7a4y2aamqukYrmqv9NmoaignmK0qrDDoqWgZaKWsKmxy2armrGcpL9utsCmoJ5llKq%2FqrGMqKytnJ%2Bkv7Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-a-neutral-be-used-for-ground.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can a neutral be used for ground?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shahroz-sabzwari.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shahroz Sabzwari- Wiki, Age, Wife, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
