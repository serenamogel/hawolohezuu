He was found hiding in or near a large pile of logs behind a John Deere store in South Coventry Township, about 30 miles from a county-run <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>prison where he escaped</a> 14 days ago.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Today is a great day in Chester County. Our nightmare is finally over and the good guys won," Chester County District Attorney Deb Ryan said at a news conference Wednesday morning.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro began the news conference by announcing Cavalcante's capture, praising "the extraordinary work of law enforcement officials" from local, state and federal agencies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b4842444-ac27-41ec-b704-8caa8418e19f/cavalcante-arrest-ho-mo-20230913_1694611993271_hpMain_16x9.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lt. Col. George Bivens, deputy commissioner of operations for the Pennsylvania State Police, said a federal Drug Enforcement Administration fixed-wing aircraft using infrared imaging technology picked up a heat source in the area of South Coventry Township around 1 a.m., but a lightning storm forced the aircraft to land.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bivens said a state police tactical unit and a U.S. Customs and Border Protection team from El Paso, Texas, quickly surrounded the area and maintained a perimeter until Wednesday morning when they moved in. Bivens said Cavalcante didn't realize he was cornered until he saw the officers coming toward him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/69992479-8a74-444f-b191-9622a1bd5c5c/Cavalcante-ht-er-230913_1694638434666_hpEmbed_4x5.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Tactical teams converged on the area where the heat source was. They were able to move in very quietly. They had the element of surprise," Bivens said. "Cavalcante did not realize he was surrounded until that had occurred."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">He said Cavalcante did not surrender immediately. He said the fugitive tried to get away by crawling through thick brush while armed with a .22-caliber rifle he stole from a nearby residence Tuesday night.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bivens said Yoda, a 4-year-old Belgian Malinois from the Border Patrol team, was sent in and was able to help detain Cavalcante, biting him at least once. No shots were fired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/57c60f07-0d6e-479c-992b-1ca3147a2949/yoda_ht-gmh-230913_1694639864071_hpEmbed_13x7.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">There were no injuries to law enforcement officers, Bivens said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"The dog subdued him and team members from both of those teams immediately moved in," Bivens said. "He continued to resist, but was forcibly taken into custody."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">He said Cavalcante was bitten on the scalp and was treated at the scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7d5df903-a553-4ab2-a03d-b6fb392fbb0f/cavalcante-arrest-ht-jef-230913_1694642090015_hpEmbed_4x3.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Asked why lethal force was not used when Cavalcante resisted, Bivens said, "That option is only to prevent the escape of a very dangerous individual."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Had they not been able to contain him, that would have remained an option," Bivens said, adding that 20 to 25 officers were involved in Cavalcante's arrest.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Shortly after the arrest, a large group of officers posed for a photo with Cavalcante, who was in handcuffs, soaking wet and wearing a gray Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt he allegedly stole during his time on the lam. He was also wearing dark work boots he swiped from a residence Tuesday night and dark pants he was wearing when he escaped, officials said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I'm aware that there was a photo op that was taken out there. Those men and women worked amazingly hard through some trying circumstances. They're proud of their work," Bivens said. "I'm not bothered at all by that. They took a photo with him in custody."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Cavalcante was loaded in the back of an armored vehicle and driven to the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Avondale, where investigators hoped to question him, Bivens said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">As the armored vehicle carrying Cavalcante approached the police barracks in Avondale, some residents in the area lined the roadway cheering, pumping their fists in the air and applauding.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I can assure you he will not escape while he is in our custody," Bivens said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In interviews with authorities hours after his capture, Cavalcante allegedly revealed that he was planning to steal a car and drive to the U.S.-Canada border.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"He stated he intended to carjack somebody in the next 24 hours and that he was going to head north to Canada," Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Robert Clark told ABC News on Wednesday.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Cavalcante also allegedly told authorities that they were so close, they nearly stepped on him at least three times during the manhunt.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"He said on multiple occasions law enforcement officers almost stepped on him, we were only five or six feet away," Clark said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The fugitive claimed to have survived on the run, in part, by eating watermelon. He was also able to stay clean shaven from a razor that was in a backpack he had obtained, according to Clark.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Cavalcante was arraigned Wednesday on a felony escape charge and denied bail, court records show. He is scheduled to next appear in court on Sept. 27 for a preliminary hearing.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bivens said Cavalcante will eventually be transferred to a state prison to begin serving out his life sentence for the brutal 2021 murder of his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, who was stabbed 38 times in a Schuylkill Township, Pennsylvania, home in front of her two young children.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The end of the two-week manhunt for the 34-year-old Cavalcante came as a relief to residents in Chester County, who had been advised by officials to stay alert and keep their doors and windows locked. Several schools in Pocopson Township canceled classes as the search for Cavalcante intensified.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A combination of tactical teams from Pennsylvania State Police, FBI and Border Patrol brought Cavalcante into custody, according to a law enforcement source.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/dc9d2a52-c8ca-4589-8ce8-66743506d5c6/Danelo-Cavalcante-1-ht-gmh-230906_1694034972282_hpMain_4x5.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Cavalcante, who officials said is also <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>wanted in his native Brazil on homicide charges</a>, escaped from the Chester County Prison in Pocopson Township on Aug. 31.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Cavalcante was noticed missing that morning about an hour after his escape when inmates returned from the exercise yard at the prison, where he was being held pending transfer to a state correctional institution.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Cavalcante followed the same method of escape and route used by an inmate at the Chester County Prison, Howard Holland acting warden of the prison, told reporters during a recent press briefing. Inmate Igor Vidra Bolte broke out of the prison in Pocopson Township on May 19 by scaling a wall in an exercise yard to gain access to the roof, according to a criminal complaint obtained by ABC News.<br></p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Cavalcante <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>escaped from the prison</a> by "crab walking" up a wall, pushing his way through razor wire installed after Bolte's escape, running across the prison roof and scaling more razor wire, before jumping down to a less secure area to make his getaway, Holland said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Holland noted that "one key difference" between the two escapes was the actions of a tower guard whose primary responsibility was to monitor inmates in the exercise yard.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"In Bolte's escape, the tower officer observed the subject leaving the yard area and contacted control immediately. That is why Bolte was apprehended within 5 minutes," Holland said. "In the escape of Cavalcante, the tower officer did not observe nor report the escape. The escape was discovered as part of the inmate counts that occur when the inmates come in from the exercise yard."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The corrections officer on duty in the guard tower at the time <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>was terminated</a> on Sept. 7, officials said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Holland said during the press briefing on Sept. 6 that steps are being taken now to completely enclose the eight exercise yards at the prison, which are now open-air. He said additional security cameras will also be installed and additional officers will be on the ground to help the tower officers monitor the inmates in the exercise yards.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The search for Cavalcante was initially centered in an area near the Chester County Prison, where he had been spotted multiple times, officials said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A citizen reported seeing a man matching Cavalcante's description on Sept. 7 running through the area near Longwood Gardens, a sprawling horticulture attraction located about 5 miles southwest of the prison, Bivens said. The search perimeter shifted toward Longwood Gardens, and Calvalcante was spotted two more times in the search area on Sept. 8, state police said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bivens said nearly 400 people from multiple agencies were engaged in the manhunt on Sept. 8, adding that they will "keep up this search at whatever tempo is appropriate for as long as we need to. He's a dangerous individual."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/70b7c06b-31aa-4550-bd0b-931a2f39d88c/escapee-danelo-cavalcante-ht-jef-230905_1693920544551_hpMain.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A Chester County jury on Aug. 16 convicted Cavalcante of first-degree murder in the fatal 2021 stabbing in Brandao.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The jury took just 15 minutes of deliberations before voting unanimously to convict Cavalcante.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Prosecutors said Brandao was killed after she learned Cavalcante was wanted for murder in Brazil and threatened to expose him to police, officials said in a statement following Cavalcante's conviction.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Following Brandao's murder, Cavalcante fled to Virginia, where he was arrested and brought back to Pennsylvania to face justice for Brandao's killing.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Brandao's sister, Sarah Brandao, released a <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>statement on Instagram</a> following the arrest, thanking law enforcement officials for capturing Cavalcante.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Right now, my family and I need to regroup and focus on processing everything that has happened while taking care of ourselves," wrote Sarah Brandao, who along with her family lives in the Chester County area where the search was being conducted.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">During the search for Cavalcante, Sarah Brandao and her family members were placed under 24-hour protection, Ryan said at a recent news conference.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"The last two weeks have been extremely painful and terrifying as they have brought back all the feelings of losing my sister and the idea that the criminal could crush us again," Sarah Brandao wrote.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">It was the second time in less than two months that a dangerous inmate had escaped from a Pennsylvania lockup. Inmate Michael Burham, who is a suspect in the rape and murder of a 34-year-old woman in Jamestown, New York, escaped from the Warren County Jail in northern Pennsylvania on July 6.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Burham, an Army reserve sergeant who authorities said was a "self-taught survivalist," was captured on July 15 following a massive manhunt in the northern Pennsylvania woods.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">ABC News' Ahmad Hemingway and Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunChsmibmqaVobxur8CvmKWbkaPBpnnMmqWhrZ6peqa%2FwpqnnpxdosKzsMSrnKtno6m8s8Weopt2aWBnhXp%2BkXBv</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gabe-escobar-tiktok-star-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-dating-girlfriend-career-net-worth-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gabe Escobar (TikTok Star) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Dating, Girlfriend, Career, Net Worth, Fa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-def-noodles-girlfriend-age-gap-and-real-name-609050-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Def Noodles Girlfriend?
