Pryor, born on December 1st, 1940 in Peoria, Illinois, was a versatile individual, excelling as an actor, comedian, satirist, writer, and film director. Over the course of his career, which spanned from 1963 to 1997, Pryor achieved significant recognition, winning five Grammy Awards, two American Academy of Humour Awards, an Emmy Award, the Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humour, and the Writers Guild of America Award. This widespread acknowledgment and admiration for his work substantially contributed to his net worth. In addition, Pryor managed to top the list of Comedy Central as the all-time greatest stand-up comedian.</p><p>Pryor’s childhood was marked by adversity as he was raised in his grandmother’s brothel, and his mother worked as a prostitute there. He endured physical and mental abuse from his grandmother. In his adult life, he served in the US Army from 1958 to 1960, spending most of his time in prison due to a racial discrimination incident in Germany.</p><p>Pryor’s career was heavily influenced by esteemed artists such as Lewis Black, Bill Hicks, Dave Chappelle, Eddie Izzard, George Lopez, and George Carlin. As an actor, he delivered remarkable performances in various films, significantly contributing to his net worth. Additionally, he released around 20 albums and eight compilations, achieving certifications for sales that further elevated his net worth.</p><p>Despite suffering from multiple sclerosis, Pryor continued to appear in films, with his last appearance being in “Lost Highway” in 1997, directed by David Lynch. Pryor passed away in 2005 following a heart attack and was cremated. His personal life was characterized by unique storylines as he married five women a total of seven times and fathered six children.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Salary</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul>Full Name: Richard Pryor<br>Net Worth: $40 Million<br>Date Of Birth: December 1,1940, in Peoria, Illinois USA<br>Died: December 10, 2005 in Los Angeles, California, USA,<br>Place Of Birth: Peoria<br>Height: 1.78 m<br>Profession: Comedian, Actor, Screenwriter, Film Producer, Master of Ceremonies, Writer, Television producer<br>Nationality: United States of America<br>Spouse: Jennifer Lee, Flynn Belaine, Deborah McGuire, Shelley R.
