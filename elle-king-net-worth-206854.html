They honored and supported her lessons of acting, skating, playing musical instruments and other hobbies. She was born out of a typical Vegas marriage because her parents got married 3 days after their first meeting, so it‚Äôs no wonder they divorced soon after her birth.</p><h2>Boyfriends & Girlfriends, Relationship</h2><p><b>Sexual Orientation:</b> straight</p><p>The singer keeps saying that ‚ÄúOx‚Äôs and Oh‚Äôs‚Äù is all about her boyfriends, so it‚Äôs obvious she had many of them in the past.

In Elle King‚Äôs biography, there are not so many talks and rumors about her boyfriends or affairs in 2015, and it seems like she didn‚Äôt have a lasting and happy relationship with any of her ex-boyfriends. She got hurt for the first rime, so she didn‚Äôt have much interest in dating later. Moreover, Elle wrote her song ‚ÄúLove Stuffs‚Äù based on her past experiences when being hurt many times. She is a successful and pretty woman with many fans following her on social networks, who needs to travel a lot with interesting people. So, everything is ahead for her.</p><h2>Elle King Money, Net Worth</h2><p><b>Net Worth:</b> The young singer succeeded a lot in her career and earned more than $1 million (2015).</p><h2>Houses & Cars</h2><p><b>Place of living:</b> King was born in LA, but grew up in southern Ontario.
