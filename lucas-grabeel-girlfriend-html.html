The last thing I want to do is take an opportunity away from other people. As a straight white man, I know that, even without trying, I’ve taken opportunities away from people.</p><p>Grabeel further stressed the importance of educating people from a young age about LGBTIQ+ people. He also added it was the responsibility of those in the film industry to use their platform to educate as well as entertain.</p><h2>What Is Grabeel Up To?</h2><p>After High School Musical, Grabeel went on to play in several other movies and TV series including CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2010), Smallville (2006-2011), Sheriff Callie’s Wild West (2014-2017), and Switched at Birth (2011-2017).&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Grabeel has also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">voiced</a> many beloved characters in animated series like Family Guy (2010-2020), Cleopatra in Space (2020), Elena of Avalor (2016-2019), and the main character in&nbsp;Pinky Malinky (2018-2019). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Almost 11 years after appearing in the 3rd High School Musical movie, the actor once again returned to the High School Musical world. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He played himself in <a href=# rel=follow>High School Musical</a>: The Musical: The Series in 2019.
