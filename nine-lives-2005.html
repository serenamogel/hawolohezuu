To know why they broke up or to see them get back together would involve us in a full-length love story of the sort we are familiar with.</p><p>It might be a good one. But here, in this meeting that is seen in one unbroken shot in a supermarket, we see the crucial heart of their relationship. It is based on the truth that their lives have moved on. Perhaps they should have stayed together. But they didn't. It's not important to know whether they start seeing each other again. But it is important for them to know that they want to, because to live without that knowledge is to dishonor their real feelings.</p><p>This little story, starring <a href=#>Robin Wright</a> Penn and <a href=#>Jason Isaacs</a>, is told in "Nine Lives," a collection of nine vignettes written and directed by <a href=#>Rodrigo Garcia</a>. Each one contains a moment of truth, each one is about the same length, each one is told in a single shot, although the camera work isn't showy.</p><p>Sometimes the episodes seem obvious at first. <a href=#>Kathy Baker</a> plays a woman who will undergo breast surgery in a few hours. In her hospital bed, she is frightened and angry; she's short-tempered with the nurses, and hard on her husband (<a href=#>Joe Mantegna</a>). A nurse adds a sedative to her IV drip, and she grows calmer and then -- well, happy. She sees the good in things. The sedative has done its work.</p><p>But the episode is about so much more than that. It is about the indignity of surgeons inserting knives into your unconscious body, and about the fear of loss, and the impersonality of hospitals but the humanity of nurses, and the patience and love of her husband. Was she acting bitchy? When you're about to get a breast removed, you're not going for a good grade in deportment. Sometimes we behave badly for the best reasons in the world, and this movie knows that.</p><p>Other scenes. There is a prisoner (<a href=#>Elpidia Carrillo</a>), who gets crazy because this is visitor's day and her daughter is on the other side of the glass, and the telephone doesn't work. An angry daughter (<a href=#>Lisa Gay Hamilton</a>), who returns after a long absence to the home where she was raised and abused. This woman, so wounded, so borderline, is the same woman who, we discover in the hospital scene, is the nurse who is gentle and cares. <a href=#>Sissy Spacek</a> plays a despairing mother in a dysfunctional household in one segment, and turns up in another prepared, perhaps, to have a forbidden night in a motel with <a href=#>Aidan Quinn</a>. <a href=#>Glenn Close</a> and <a href=#>Dakota Fanning</a> visit a cemetery together in the last story, where the final shot will blindside you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46noKedXaG2t7HSZmlpaGU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./excadrill-pok-c3-a9mon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Excadrill (Pokmon)/Generation V learnset - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./john-mayer-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>John Mayer Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
