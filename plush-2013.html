It also opened at nearly $70 million, the biggest debut for a female director—which, in theory, should have opened countless doors and allowed Hardwicke to make any sort of film she wanted.&nbsp;And so she made the soapy, chintzy "<a href=#>Red Riding Hood</a>" (2011), which suggested what it might look like if the "Twilight" kids got dressed up and went to the Renaissance Faire.&nbsp;</p><p>Her latest film is the clunky "Plush," a psychological thriller set in the Los Angeles rock scene.&nbsp;It feels so inauthentic at every turn, it's as if the film itself is unsure of what it's supposed to be. Camp? Not camp? A cautionary tale? A rock 'n' roll fable? A tragic example of obsession? Or maybe just an excuse to wallow in debauchery?&nbsp;It does feature some of he most lifeless and unconvincing concert scenes I've ever seen; meanwhile, the backstage moments consist of nonstop smoking and champagne swilling, shorthand for danger and self-destruction.</p><p>Heavy narration over a long opening flashback is meant to fill in some of the emotional gaps, but it's just one of many examples of the film spelling out everything. Hayley (<a href=#>Emily Browning</a> in Goth-chick mode) explains in detail how she and her beloved brother, Jack (<a href=#>Thomas Dekker</a>), grew up in Texas writing and singing their own songs.&nbsp;"Music was like our secret place," she says in girlish, wistful tones. "Nothing could hurt us because Jack and I had each other."</p><p>In no time, they've moved to Los Angeles and formed a band called Plush. At 19, she's pregnant with twin boys and marrying a hunky journalist named Carter, played by <a href=#>Cam Gigandet</a>. ("Carter's daughter, Lila, was our flower girl," Hayley explains in one of the more awkward pieces of voiceover in the script from Hardwicke and <a href=#>Arty Nelson</a>. "She lives with her mom half the time.")</p><p>Plush is a smash, which inspires all the creepy fan worship and drug abuse you might expect. Then one night after a concert, Jack overdoses on heroin, sending Hayley reeling. She records a new album in his honor with painfully literal lyrics like: "Half of me is gone." Audiences and critics reject it, sending her into a further spiral.</p><p>She thinks she's found her savior in the band's new guitarist, Enzo (<a href=#>Xavier Samuel</a>, who recently played Naomi Watts' surfing son in the mom-swapping drama "<a href=#>Adore</a>"). Not only does he know all her old songs, he inspires her to push through her own limits in writing new ones.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Enzo may also be bisexual, and a stalker. That's not a spoiler, by the way: the tattoo right above Enzo's butt crack of both Hayley <i>and</i> Jack's pictures gives his orientation away, and the stalker part is telegraphed as well.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46po66rmGJ%2FcX2S</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adriana-barraza.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adriana Barraza movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-brendan-depa-autistic-arrest-charge-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Brendan Depa Autistic | Arrest Charge News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
