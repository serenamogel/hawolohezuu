A progressive Democrat, she successfully ran for Congress in 2018 and was re-elected in 2020. In December 2020, President Joe Biden nominated Haaland as his Secretary of the Interior. This position oversees public lands and manages the U.S. government's treaties and legal obligations to 574 federally recognized tribes. Haaland was confirmed in March 2021, making her the first Native American to be part of a president's Cabinet.</p><h2 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Debra Anne Haaland<br>BORN: December 2, 1960<br>BIRTHPLACE: Winslow, Arizona<br>PARTY: Democratic Party<br>OFFICE: United States Secretary of Interior<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius</p><h2 title="Family Background" data-anchor-id=family-background class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Family Background<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Haaland is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe. The matrilineal tribe has been in what is now New Mexico since the 1200s. Due to this heritage, Haaland calls herself a 35th-generation New Mexican.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Haaland's mother, Mary Toya, was a Navy veteran who worked in Indian education at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
