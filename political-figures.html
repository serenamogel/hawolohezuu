In 1928, Hoover was elected president, but eight months later the stock market crash of 1929 occurred, ushering in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Great Depression" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Great Depression</a>. Hoover’s policies could not overcome the economic destruction and despair that resulted, and he lost his reelection bid in 1932.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa, and was the first president born west of the Mississippi River. When Hoover was 6 years old, his father died. Three years later his mother also died, and Hoover was then raised in Oregon by his maternal aunt and uncle.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Humanitarian Efforts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A lifelong humanitarian, as an adult, Hoover was in China during the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/china/boxer-rebellion data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Boxer Rebellion" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Boxer Rebellion</a> (1900), and he organized the relief efforts for trapped foreigners. Four years later, he helped Americans stranded in Europe when World War I began, and for three years after, he headed the Commission for Relief in Belgium, helping to procure food for 9 million Belgians in the aftermath of the massive encroachment of German troops. His effectiveness prompted President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/woodrow-wilson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Woodrow Wilson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Woodrow Wilson</a> to appoint Hoover head of the Food Administration, which diverted American agricultural products overseas to American troops.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hoover next served as head of the American Relief Administration, which helped post-WWI Europe feed its people. President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/warren-g-harding data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Warren G. Harding" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Warren G. Harding</a> then picked Hoover to be his secretary of commerce, as did President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/calvin-coolidge data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Calvin Coolidge" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Calvin Coolidge</a> after him. In this role, he was the driving force behind such projects as the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Hoover Dam.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">President and Great Depression</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When President Coolidge decided not to run for another term, Hoover was nominated as the Republican candidate in 1928. He ran against New York governor Alfred E. Smith and won in a landslide. During Hoover’s campaign, he famously said, “We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land,” but less than a year later the stock market crash of 1929 struck, and the worst economic downturn in American history was upon Hoover’s administration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hoover’s plan to attack the Great Depression had as its backbone tax cuts and public works projects: keep more money in people’s pockets, and keep people working. He also contacted business leaders and urged them not to cut wages or lay off workers, and in 1932, he backed the establishment of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a lending institution intended to help banks and industries in their recovery efforts. Unfortunately, none of these approaches helped the foundering economy, and Hoover watched helplessly while businesses closed their doors and Americans sank into poverty. He also made a critical mistake in signing into law the Smoot-Hawley Act, which raised taxes on imports and prompted foreign nations to turn their backs on American-made goods when the country desperately needed sales.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When the election of 1932 came around, Hoover blamed the depression on factors beyond his control, but the public either didn’t care or wasn’t buying it, and he was trounced by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-d-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin D. Roosevelt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Post-Presidency and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the ensuing years, Hoover continually attacked government programs such as FDR’s New Deal in books he wrote, such as The Challenge to Liberty (1934) and the eight-volume Addresses Upon the American Road (1936–1961). He also delivered speeches on the matter, including “Against the Proposed New Deal” (1932) and “The New Deal and European Collectivism” (1936).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hoover opposed American entry into World War II (until <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/pearl-harbor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pearl Harbor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pearl Harbor</a> was attacked) and condemned American involvement in the Korean and Vietnam wars. He was working on another book when he died in New York City in 1964, at age 90.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The 31st president has been the subject of several biographies, including a multi-volume work by historian George H. Nash. In 2017, journalist Kenneth Whyte introduced a new profile to the collection, Hoover: An Extraordinary Life in Extraordinary Times, which explored the former president's lengthy record of public service and the events that shaped his personality and decision-making.</p><ul data-node-id=19 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Herbert Hoover</li><li>Birth Year: 1874</li><li>Birth date: August 10, 1874</li><li>Birth State: Iowa</li><li>Birth City: West Branch</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Herbert Hoover was the 31st president of the United States, whose term was notably marked by the stock market crash of 1929 and the beginnings of the Great Depression.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Leo</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Stanford University</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1964</li><li>Death date: October 20, 1964</li><li>Death State: New York</li><li>Death City: New York</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Herbert Hoover Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/political-figures/herbert-hoover</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 16, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGinqKSZqbakrctmnaKfpaeytHvHnqmbnaKpeqm7zq%2Bcqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-donner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Movies directed by Richard Donner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dejan-milojevic-family-wife-children-parents-siblings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dejan Milojevi family, wife, children, parents, siblings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
