The truly great caper movies (Yates' "Robbery," about England's Great Train Robbery, is a good example) are single-mindedly devoted to their steel-trap plots, and characterization has to tunnel in from underneath, or find a home in the crevices between dialog.&amp;nbsp;

Civilization V continues to be the oddball among our benchmarks. Having started out as a title with low framerates and poor multi-GPU scaling, in recent months AMD and NVIDIA have rectified this some. &amp;nbsp;As a result it’s now possible to crack 60fps at 2560 with a pair of high-end GPUs, albeit with some difficulty. In our experience Civ V is a hybrid bottlenecked game – we have every reason to believe it’s bottlenecked by the CPU at certain points, but the disparity between NVIDIA and AMD’s performance indicates there’s a big difference in how the two are settings things up under the hood.</description></item><item><title>What to Buy at Dollar Tree?

多くのファンが待ち望んだ再始動も、2019年に起きたあるゴシップが中心となり、泡となって消えました。
ジャンヌダルクの解散が正式に決定したきっかけは、ベースのka-yuさんが起こした、ある騒動にあるとされています。
ベースのka-yuさんが脱退、そして事務所の退社が決まったことで、これまでに空中分解していたバンドにとどめを刺してしまったのです。
2019年に解散して大きな話題となりましたが、ヴィジュアル系ファンが集う掲示板「たぬき」では、未だにka-yuさん関係の話題が続いています。
今日はka-yuさんの現在と、当時騒がれた騒動でわかっていることなどについて書いてみたいと思います。
たぬき掲示板では「集団訴訟」など物騒な言葉が飛び交っていましたが、ka-yuさんは具体的にどんなことをしてしまったのでしょうか？
2019年のJanne Da Arc解散騒動。理由はka-yuだけじゃない？ 2019年4月1日に12年以上にも渡る活動休止期間を経て、Janne Da Arcは解散を発表しました。
解散を発表した前日の3月31日にベースのka-yuがバンドを脱退しました。
同時に、所属事務所アップライズ・プロダクトを退所していたことが報告されたことから、バンドの解散の主な理由はka-yuさんにあるとされています。
ちなみに、解散発表当日4月1日はエイプリルフールだったということで、一部のファンが「解散とみせかけて再始動？」と淡い期待を抱いてしまったそうです。
実際は、前日に解散する他ない動きがあっただけでした。
再始動する気配はなかったがka-yuの不祥事が都合良いきっかけになった？ ジャンヌが解散するというニュースが流れると、ka-yuさんの不祥事が解散を決めたきっかけになったかのように報道されました。
2007年からバンドとしての活動を休止し、各メンバーがソロやユニットとして音楽活動を行ってきたJanne Da Arc。バンドを脱退し、所属事務所アップライズ・プロダクトからも退所したいというka-yuの意向を受けて、ka-yu以外のメンバーとスタッフとの間でJanne Da Arcの未来についてさまざまな話し合いが行われた。その結果、現在yasuが体の治療のためアーティスト活動を休んでいることもあり、現時点でJanne Da Arcとしての新しい提案や具体的な指針を示すことを約束できない状況の中で、4人のJanne Da Arcとして活動を存続することは非現実的であるという結論にいたり、この度Janne Da Arcは正式な解散声明をオフィシャルサイトで発表した。引用元：Yahoo!ニュース
ka-yuさんの脱退の経緯は、前年2018年の9月に弁護士事務所からアップライズ・プロダクトへka-yu宛の内容証明郵便が届いたことから始まります。
所属事務所はその手紙の内容を見て、
「もしも全て事実であるなら、社会的正義から著しく反する行為」
であったため本人に、
「反省すべきところは反省をし、一日も早く自らの潔白を証明すること、そしてその後は応援してくださっているファンの皆様のことを第一に考えて、Janne Da Arcのメンバーであるという自負のもと音楽活動に専念してほしい」
と伝えたそうです。
その後にka-yuさん本人から、
「Janne Da Arcは大切だし、比較するものではないかもしれないが、どちらかを選べと言われればJanne Da Arcよりも大事にしたいものが見つかったため、Janne Da Arcを脱退し事務所を辞めます」
と決断したことから、事務所退所が決定したのです。
この時点で、ジャンヌの解散が決まったわけではありません。
クリエイティブではない環境とyasuの休業と重ねてka-yuの不祥事 ボーカルのyasuさんが2017年から健康上の理由で歌手活動を休止してるという状況も踏まえ、他メンバーと事務所で話し合った結果、解散という決断に至ったのです。
つまりは、バンドとしての未来が作りにくかった2007年の状況に加えて、yasuさんの休業、そしてka-yuさんの退所と、１つ１つ積み重なって末に、バンド解散に至ったというわけです。
ka-yuさんひとりの暴走でジャンヌが解散したと勘違いしてる人もいるみたいですが、それは違います。
ka-yuは何をしたのか？たくさんの女性ファンに悪行で集団訴訟？
2019年のジャンヌ解散のニュースの際には、ka-yuさんが何か悪いことをしたかのようなことが書かれていました。
しかし、ニュースではka-yuさんが具体的にどのようなことをしたのかまでは報道されていませんでした。
ヴィジュアル系ファンが多く集う匿名掲示板「たぬき」では、ka-yuさんのやったことの憶測が多く書き込まれました。
たぬき掲示板に書かれた内容が事実なのかは不明ですが、
・抱いた女性にお金をもらう
・接待のお店で働かせてお金を作らせる
・女性が断ると「動画ばら撒く」
・怖い系の人にお金の回収をさせていた
↑主にこのような内容が書き込まれていました。
たぬき掲示板ではka-yuの集団訴訟のトピが乱立 実は随分と前から、たぬき掲示板ではka-yuさんの上記のような噂が書き込まれていました。
「わたしも！」という風に乗る形の書き込みが多くありましたが、長くはファンの妄想だと思われていました。
しかし、いつしか「集団訴訟」というワードが登場し、次第に書き込みの内容も生々しくなっていきました。
悪ノリが過激になっただけ？と思われた矢先、2019年4月1日のジャンヌ解散ニュースにある事務所の”社会的正義から著しく反する行為”という発表だったことから、それらが本当だったのか？（確定ではない）となったのです。
インスタなどのSNS削除で噂に真実味？ 仮に上記のような噂が嘘だったとしたら、逆にka-yuさんが訴えることが可能です。</description></item><item><title>Simon Schofield</title><link>/simon-schofield.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/simon-schofield.html</guid><description>Simon Schofield is a 36 years old British singer and actor.

Answer
As long as x=y is true, y may be used in place of x in any expression. The replacement property is more comprehensive than the transitive property in that it allows one to substitute x for y in y=z on any expression, rather than only y in y=z. The replacement attribute can be used just in one occurrence, as shown by its transitivity.

及びにヴィジュアル系に革命を起こして、
伝説的バンドであるmalice mizer。
GACKTさんをボーカルに迎えていた時代は、
「これからメジャーで大暴れする！」と、
多くのファンが期待し、malice mizerの天下を夢見ていたことでしょう。
現在は活動が止まっているものの、
今でも多くの信者を抱え、
リーダーのManaさんを愛してやまない方が多いです。
malice mizerはステージのセットが、インディーズ時代から凝っており、
マナさんが自宅から家具を持ち出すなど、ライブが始まる前の準備に追われていたそうです。
そんなmalice mizerのトレードマークと言えるのが、
中世ヨーロッパの貴族をイメージしたような、
白塗りの人形のようなメイクです。
GACKTさんは王子様なのに対して、
リーダーのマナさんはお姫様のようなメイクをしていました。
今となって気になるのは、
malice mizerのメンバーのすっぴん、
特に一際美しかったマナさんのすっぴんですね。
malice mizerのManaのすっぴん。画像はない malice mizerのメンバーは、
ライブ以外のメディア活動でも、
濃い白塗りのメイクを施してました。
「笑っていいとも!」に出演した際にも、
濃いメイクでタモリさんを驚かせていました。
しかし、脱退したメンバーのテツさんは、
他の活動で堂々とすっぴんで活動していたり、
GACKTさんも、時よりすっぴんに近い姿を公開してます。
それでも、一番すっぴんが気になる、
リーダーのマナさんのすっぴんは一切公開されていません。
マナさんは、今の別の活動の中でも、
きっちとメイクを施しており、
ヴィジュアル的には全盛期と変わらない完成度を維持してます。
どこにもマナさんのすっぴんの画像はない・・・、
だとしても、過去のmalice mizer関連の本の中で、
インタビュアーがメンバーのすっぴんを見た感想などはあります。
malice mizerはメンバー全員が、
もともと男前で、すっぴんでも全然いけるバンドなのです。
特にマナさんとGACKTさんは、
顔の輪郭から目鼻の作りまで、
メイクをしてなくても整ってのはわかります。
これからマナさんのすっぴんを見てる機会来るのか・・・？
現在の年齢はいくつになるのでしょうか？
GACKTさんが既に４０歳を超えているので、マナさんもなかなかです。
今後、幾つになってもメイクをして活動を続けていくのか、
それとも、どこかですっぴんを公開する機会が訪れるのか、
今後もマナさんの動向には目が離せません！
malice mizerのkamiの生年月日と命日(お墓) malice mizer最大の悲劇といえば、
全盛期でのボーカルのGACKTさんの脱退です。
