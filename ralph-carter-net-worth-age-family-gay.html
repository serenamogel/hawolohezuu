He was born Ralph David Carter on 30th May 1961, in New York City, New York, in the United States of America. There is no public record of his family history, parents, siblings, and educational background.</p><p>Ralph Carter snagged his first acting role at the age of 10 as a fill-in in the 1971 Broadway musical The Me Nobody Knows, after which he joined other actors as Travis Younge in the musical Raisin. His role in the project was so impressive that it earned him the 1974 Theatre World Award, the 1973 Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Performer, and a nomination for the 1974 Tony Award in the category for Best Supporting or Featured Actor in a Musical.</p><p>The former child actor caught the attention of the public in 1974 when he made his first TV appearance in the musical Good Times Back. His involvement in the project skyrocketed him to fame and also paved the way for the start-up of his singing career. He also appeared in hit dramas such as Via-Galactica and Dude, as well as The Karl Max Play, an off-Broadway production play.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/carter3-e1579173728719.jpg><p>Ralph Carter collaborated with Mercury Records in 1976 to release his only album titled Young And In Love. His active phase in Hollywood eventually ended in 1987, eight years after <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Good Times</a> was discontinued. He is said to have invested much of his time in the 1980s performing in nightclubs as a baritone balladeer. Following his active days as a nightclub performer, Ralph slowly slipped into obsolescence.</p><h2><strong>What is&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ralph Carter’s&nbsp;</strong><strong>Net Worth and How Did He Make His Money?</strong></h2><p>As of today, Ralph Carter has a net worth of $1.5 million. He basically made his money through his acting career in Hollywood. Even though his career did not last long for him to attain the status of a high net-worth individual, proceeds from his active acting days and sales from his music endeavors have been able to keep him away from financial problems or hard times. It is not known if Carter was able to set up other businesses in the States after his retirement, but it is known that his other income sources are from his appearances at various events and TV shows.</p><h2><strong>What Is Ralph Carter Doing Now?</strong></h2><p>Ever since Ralph Carter turned his back on Hollywood and the spotlight, getting in touch with him has been very difficult. He rarely makes public appearances, but he was seen in 2006 at the BET Awards with his Good Times co-stars—Janet Jackson, Jimmie Walker, and Bern Nadette Stanis. The former actor once appeared on an episode of E! True Hollywood Story, where he shared the story behind the TV sitcom Good Times.</p><p>Carter made his last known theater appearance for the Classical Theatre of Harlem Company in the year 2005 in the play Ain’t Supposed to Die a Natural Death. This is after he went into hiding in 1987, the same year he retired from acting business.</p><p>According to recent reports,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Good Times&nbsp;actor is currently based in his state of birth, New York. He also serves in an organization known as the Audience Development Committee (AUDELCO) as its vice president.&nbsp; The organization, as gathered, was established to appreciate the contributions of Afro-Americans to the theater world.</p><p>While remembering Good Times, Ralph was quoted as saying that it would always be a part of his life. He also added:</p><p>I was fortunate to be in the explosion, not only of the African-American theater in the 1970s but into that wave of consciousness and beautiful television productions that featured African-American artists. I’m very grateful for the people who taught me along the way</p>.<p>The retired actor is currently living in New York City with his wife and kids. He does not have any social media profile, which could have given more insight into his current life. There’s an Instagram fan page, though, which is <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">available here</a></p><h2><strong>All You Need To Know About&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ralph Carter’s&nbsp;</strong><strong>Wife And Children</strong></h2><p>Ralph Carter has been married twice – first to Lisa Parks and later to River York. He met Lisa, a sister to his best friend Larry Parks, in 1982 while attending a Christmas party. They eventually tied the knot on February 5, 1987, about six months after their engagement in July of the previous year. The couple had two children together, Michael Carter (born 1988) and James Carter (born 1989). After about five years together, the couple divorced.</p><p>Ralph met and married River York in 1994, two years after his first marriage ended. The two share three children: a boy named Pheonix (born in 1995) and 2 girls named Jessica (born in 1997) and Vivica (born in 1999). Carter’s family members live far away from the spotlight; they hate being in the public eye and have never been at celebrity gatherings. Nevertheless, we believe they are doing great in their various fields of endeavor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC%2BwKWnoWWTlr%2B1sdFmpZ6sXay8s8DHZpignV2brq61y7JkoJmpZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./armin-van-buuren-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Armin van Buuren Net Worth: Music Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-clarke-duncan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Clarke Duncan movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
