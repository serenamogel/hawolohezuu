It sounds great (and sometimes is), but Lindeen's hands-off approach—he mostly lets the Acalians interrogate each other—starts to wear thin whenever his subjects try to explain their complex feelings of resentment, skepticism, and nostalgia about what happened during the Acali's journey. There's consequently a weird circular logic to Lindeen's presentation: he seems reluctant to super-impose an artificial narrative onto the group's experiences—since Genoves already tried and failed to do that in his journals and notes—but he doesn't ask his subjects enough follow-up questions to get worthwhile, memorable answers from them. In "The Raft," less authorial control doesn't necessarily make for a better story.</p><p data-children-count=0>Lindeen must organize and comment on his subjects' experiences, if only for the sake of establishing a timeline of events. He invites the six surviving Acali crew members (minus the late Genoves, whose thoughts are narrated by Mexican actor <a href=#>Daniel Giménez Cacho</a>) to gather and talk inside a life-sized replica of the ship. Lindeen's subjects are generally mild-mannered, but tension inevitably arises whenever they talk about Genoves. Some Acalites&nbsp;are still uncomfortable with Reves' demands of them, especially his obsession with making his subjects pair off and have sex, ostensibly for scientific purposes (in his notes, Genoves admits that he sought out "sexually attractive" participants).&nbsp;Alaskan engineer Fe Seymour remembers that Genoves wanted her and Catholic priest Bernardo (now deceased) to have sex just because they are both black.&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=0>Lindeen obviously has a low opinion of Genoves based on edited selections from Genoves' posthumously narrated writings: over the course of the Acali's 101-day tour, Genoves became the kind of toxically aggressive personality that he set out to study. There are blatant undercurrents of passive-aggression in his notes about the trip's inconclusive results ("Instead of supporting me, they behave like a bunch of little children"). Genoves' frustration was also noticed and is guardedly commented upon by the Acali's survivors, most of whom have adopted a live-and-let-live attitude.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lopaztXmRaWhy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./5-reasons-why-home-alone-2-is-the-best-movie-in-the-franchise-and-im-done-having-this-conversation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 reasons why Home Alone 2 is the best movie in the franchise, and Im done having this conv</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matilda-szydagis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside The Life Of Matilda Szydagis - Bio, Net Worth &amp;amp; Husband</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
