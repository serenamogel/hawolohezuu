He had a net worth of $200 thousand at the time of his death. He rose to fame in the early 90s as a pioneering figure on the West Coast hip hop scene. Tupac is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential rappers in history, and he sold over 75 million records worldwide. Sadly, he died on September 13, 1996, after being shot in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas.</p><h2><span id=Tupacs_Financial_Woes>Tupac’s Financial Woes</span></h2><p>Despite selling $60 million worth of albums in 1996 alone, Tupac had very little to show for his enormous success at the time of his death. He owned no real estate, had no retirement accounts, no stocks, and did not even own the Woodland Hills mansion he lived in at the end of his life. His primary assets were a five-figure life insurance policy, two cars, and a single checking account containing $105,000. Court fees and taxes consumed all of those assets in short order, leaving his estate with very little. The only asset of value that his mother received from his estate was a Mercedes Benz SL 500.</p><h2><span id=Tupacs_Estate_and_Financial_Disputes>Tupac’s Estate and Financial Disputes</span></h2><p>When Tupac died without a will, his mother Afeni took control of his estate. However, he was $4.9 million in debt to his record company Death Row. Afeni sued Death Row for withholding royalties and failing to deliver advances promised under his contract, but the company denied the claims, citing Tupac’s lavish spending habits.</p><p>Death Row produced records showing that they had loaned Tupac millions of dollars to fund his lifestyle, including buying cars, renting homes for himself and family members, paying for a $300,000 hotel tab, and supporting his mother with a $16,000 monthly payment. They also fronted $2 million to cover album and video costs related to “Makaveli: The Don Killuminati”.</p><p>When Afeni threatened to forbid the release of the album until financial questions were answered, Death Row’s distributor Interscope Records paid his estate $3 million and forgave half of the $4.9 million debt. They also agreed to pay his estate $2 million in one year and increase his royalty rate from 12% to 18%.</p><p>Despite the financial disputes, Tupac’s estate earned tens of millions through posthumous album releases, merchandise sales, and licensing deals over the following decades.</p><h2><span id=Tupac_Shakurs_Early_Life>Tupac Shakur’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Tupac Shakur was born in New York City on June 16, 1971 to Black Panther Party members Afeni and Billy.

Shakur’s fourth studio album, “All Eyez on Me,” was released in 1996, also reaching number one on the Billboard 200 and featuring hit singles “How Do U Want It” and “California Love.” Shakur’s music career continued posthumously, with several albums released after his death, including “The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,” “Still I Rise,” and “Pac’s Life.”</p><h2><span id=Shakurs_Hip_Hop_Group_Thug_Life>Shakur’s Hip Hop Group Thug Life</span></h2><p>Aside from his solo career, Tupac Shakur formed a hip hop group called Thug Life in late 1993. The group consisted of Big Syke, Macadoshis, the Rated R, and Shakur’s stepbrother Mopreme.

He also faced legal troubles in 1994 for misdemeanor assault and in 1996 for concealing a firearm and violating his release terms.</p><h2><span id=Shakurs_High-Profile_Friends_and_Short-Lived_Marriage>Shakur’s High-Profile Friends and Short-Lived Marriage</span></h2><p>Tupac Shakur had several well-known friends who supported him through his legal issues, including Jada Pinkett, Mickey Rourke, Madonna, and Jasmine Guy.</p><p>While serving time in prison in 1995, Shakur wed Keisha Morris. However, their marriage was annulled just ten months later.</p><h2><span id=Shakurs_Murders_and_Suspected_Culprits>Shakur’s Murders and Suspected Culprits</span></h2><p>Shakur was shot for the first time in 1994 during a robbery at Quad Studios in Times Square. He suspected that the shooting was a setup, alleging involvement from music manager James Rosemond and rival rappers Sean Combs and the Notorious B.I.G.</p><p>In 1996, while riding in a convoy in Las Vegas, Shakur was shot four times at a stop light and died six days later. The culprit remains unknown, with allegations ranging from Crips gang member Orlando Anderson to the Notorious B.I.G., who was also murdered in a drive-by shooting in 1997.</p><h2><span id=Tupac_Shakurs_Legacy>Tupac Shakur’s Legacy</span></h2><p>Tupac Shakur is considered one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time.
