While it still maintains a lot of the traditional elements from its origins in Japan, teriyaki sauce has developed into something unique to America. So, what is teriyaki sauce and how did it become what it is today? Let’s dig in.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-teriyaki-sauce><strong>What is teriyaki sauce?</strong></h2><p>The Japanese word “teriyaki” actually refers to a style of cooking. “Yaki” means grilled, while “teri” means shiny.</p><p>In Japan, teriyaki cooking usually involves some kind of seafood that is brushed with a sweet, thick, soy-based glaze, called tare. As the food cooks, the sauce reduces and takes on that signature shine that makes a teriyaki dish instantly identifiable.&nbsp;</p><p>Teriyaki became a hit in America in the 1960s as Japanese cuisine started to become popular, and people started to use it for more than just seafood, lacquering chicken, beef, and pork with it. Today, any dish that is made with teriyaki sauce falls under the label of teriyaki, regardless of the method used for cooking. There are a lot of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grocery store brands</a> of bottled teriyaki sauces, but you can also find more traditional Japanese imports in specialty grocery stores.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-teriyaki-sauce-made-of><strong>What is teriyaki sauce made of?</strong></h2><p>Traditionally in Japan, teriyaki sauce (or tare) is made simply with soy sauce, sugar, and mirin (a kind of rice wine that has a higher sugar content than sake). To make the sauce, you mix those ingredients together then reduce it down to achieve a thick consistency. This process carmelizes the sugar, which accounts for the teriyaki sauce’s sweetness and shiny glaze.&nbsp;</p><p>Bottled American teriyaki sauces are a bit more complex. They often include some form of vinegar, as well as other spices like ginger, onion powder, or garlic powder. Sometimes, the sugar traditionally used will be replaced with honey, or it will be enhanced with pineapple juice or some kind of citrus. And, as with most processed foods, you’re going to find preservatives or weird things like cornstarch that create a thick sauce without any boiling.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-teriyaki-sauce-have-gluten><strong>Does teriyaki sauce have gluten?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Wheat is a sneaky little ingredient in a lot of soy products, and since teriyaki sauce is primarily soy sauce, it is not gluten-free. However, there are gluten-free teriyaki sauces in the market. These sauces get around the gluten by using tamari, a type of soy sauce that has a negligible amount of wheat added. Or, they may use something like coconut aminos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-teriyaki-sauce-vegan><strong>Is teriyaki sauce vegan?</strong></h2><p>Most teriyaki sauces are vegan friendly, but always make sure to check the label. A brand’s recipe may use honey instead of sugar, which would disqualify it for vegan diners. Also, some cane sugars, especially ones processed in North America, can be considered not vegan-friendly. Incredibly, sugar is sometimes processed with something called bone char, which is used to decolorize raw cane sugar. This sounds wild—I didn’t believe it until some thorough research—but it’s true. So, if this is something that rubs you the wrong way, look for labels that use high fructose corn syrup as a replacement for sugar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-teriyaki-sauce-go-bad><strong>Does teriyaki sauce go bad?</strong></h2><p>As the saying goes, “nothing gold can stay.” And while that applies to teriyaki sauce, it is going to last significantly longer than other condiments. If refrigerated, teriyaki sauce can be used well after its best-by date, almost up to a year. However, it’s always best to give a sniff first, since it’s not immune to spoilage. You’d hate to dig deep into the back of your fridge for that forgotten bottle of teriyaki sauce, only to pour it over your chicken and find it filled with mold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BEST-TERIYAKI-SAUCE-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-teriyaki-sauce-you-can-buy><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Teriyaki Sauce You Can Buy</a></h2><p>Now that you know all about the history of teriyaki sauce, find out about the best teriyaki sauce you can buy at the grocery store.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmq56qma6urLWMrJium5Vk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sophie-nyweide.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sophie Nyweide movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-breakfast-sausage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Breakfast Sausage, Actually?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
