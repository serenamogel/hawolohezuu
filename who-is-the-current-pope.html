Francis is the first Jesuit pope, the first pope from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere and the first pope from outside of Europe since Gregory III a Syrian who ruled in the eighth century.</p><h2>Who is the Current Pope?</h2><p>Pope Francis (Jorge Mario Bergoglio; 17 December 1936) has been the leader of the Catholic Church the bishop of Rome and the sovereign of the Vatican City State since 13 March 2013 succeeding the late Benedict XVI.</p><p><strong>You can also check these latest articles:</strong></p><h2>About Pope Francis</h2><p>Bergoglio, who was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, started his career as a technician in a food science lab and afterwards worked as a bouncer and cleaner. He was motivated to join the Jesuits in 1958 after he recovered from a serious illness. In 1969 he was ordained as a Catholic priest, and from 1973 to 1979 he led the Jesuits in Argentina as provincial superior. In 1998, he was appointed Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and in 2001, Pope John Paul II elevated him to the rank of cardinal.</p><p>During the riots that took place in Argentina in December of 2001, he was at the helm of the local Church. He was seen as a threat by both Néstor and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner’s administrations. Bergoglio was chosen by a papal conclave to succeed Pope Benedict XVI on 13 March 2013, following Benedict’s retirement on 28 February 2013. In honour of Saint Francis of Assisi, he decided to take the name Francis as his papal name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jorge-Mario-Bergoglio.jpg><p>Francis has been a public figure who has been recognised for his lowliness, his focus on God’s mercy, his global prominence as pope, his care for the poor, and his dedication to interfaith understanding. He is said to have taken a more relaxed attitude to the papacy than his predecessors by, among other things, eschewing the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace in favour of the more humble quarters at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.</p><h2>Initial Stages</h2><p>On December 17, 1936, Jorge Mario Bergoglio entered this world in the Flores district of Buenos Aires. He was born to Mario José Bergoglio (1908-1959) and <a href=# rel=noopener>Regina Maria Svori</a> and he was the eldest of five children (1911–1981). Born in Portacomaro, Asti Province, Piedmont, Italy, Mario Bergoglio is an Italian immigrant and accountant. Regina Savori was a housewife from Piedmont who grew up in Buenos Aires. During the rise of fascism under Benito Mussolini in Italy in 1929, Mario José’s family made the difficult decision to leave the country.</p><p>Maria Elena Bergoglio (born 1948), the Pope’s sole surviving sibling, claims the family did not leave Argentina due to financial difficulties. Oscar Adrián (dead, 1938), Marta Regina (died, 2007), and Alberto Horacio were his other siblings (1942–2010). Both of my great uncles, Antonio and Joseph, were killed in a car accident. Artist Cristina Bergoglio is his niece. She lives and works in Madrid.</p><p>Bergoglio went to the Salesians of Don Bosco’s Wilfrid Barón de Los Santos Angeles school in Ramos Meja, Buenos Aires Province when he was in the sixth grade. Some media agencies falsely stated that he earned a master’s degree in chemistry rather than a diploma as a chemical technician from the technical secondary school named after a former president of Argentina, Escuela Técnica Industrial N° 27 Hipólito Yrigoyen. During his time there, he was a member of Esther Ballestrino’s team in the food division of Hickethier-Bachmann Laboratory. Bergoglio’s previous jobs include scrubbing floors as a janitor and working as a nightclub bouncer.</p><h2>A Few Problems In The Beginning</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/A-Few-Problems-In-The-Beginning.jpg><p>Twenty-one British Catholic peers and members of parliament from across the political spectrum petitioned Francis in March 2013 to relax celibacy requirements for priestly ordination in Great Britain. To them, it seemed strange that married Anglican priests could be welcomed into the Catholic Church and ordained as priests under the Pastoral Provision of 20 June 1980 or the 2009 Anglican ordinariate, but married Catholic men could not.</p><p>In his Easter homily in 2013, Latin Patriarch of <a href=# rel=noopener>Jerusalem Fouad Twal</a> urged Pope Francis to visit Jerusalem. The Chaldean Catholic Patriarch, Louis Raphael I, pleaded with Pope Francis to visit Iraq’s “embattled Christian community.” In March 2021, Pope Francis made history by being the first pope to visit Iraq. He met with the disintegrating Christian communities of Mesopotamia, which had been devastated by years of war.</p><p><strong>Also, check out our latest articles:</strong></p><h2>Fraud in the Banking System</h2><p>Cardinals who voted for Francis as pope gave him the task of cleaning up the Vatican’s finances after scandals during the reigns of Benedict and John Paul II. He said he’s determined to clean up the Catholic Church but isn’t holding out much hope because corruption is a human problem that’s been there for generations.</p><p><strong>Final Lines</strong></p><p>Above we have talked about who is the current pope?
