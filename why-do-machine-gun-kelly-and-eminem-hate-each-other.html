This is exactly what happened between <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Machine Gun Kelly</a></strong> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Eminem</strong></a>, and their past issues are resurfacing thanks to MGK’s apparent former girlfriend, Megan Fox. After <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deleting all traces of Kelly from her Instagram</a> and making some cryptic posts, she began following Eminem. Why was that such a bold move? Conflict never comes from nothing, and the two rappers have hated each other for a while now. So let’s take a look at the problems between Eminem and the polarizing MGK.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-where-did-the-feud-start data-injectable=false>Where did the feud start?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>There are two alleged starts to this beef, one claimed by Eminem and the other claimed by Machine Gun Kelly.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>MGK has talked about a tweet from 2012, which has long since been deleted, where he sexualized Eminem’s daughter, Hailie Jade. She was only 16 at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MGK-Eminem-tweet-2012.jpg><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Eminem denies that this is where the feud began, claiming that he only heard about the tweet after the fact. What MGK asserts is that Eminem’s people pressured him to remove the tweet, and talked to him in a conference call. Eminem then supposedly blackballed him from other opportunities, so MGK’s issue is that, in his view, an aging rapper was blocking an up and comer’s career.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=969 data-injectable=true>MGK’s response was talking about Eminem on radio shows, and eventually dropping lines insulting him on Tech N9ne’s track “No Reason (The Mosh Pit Song),” before dropping his own diss track, “Rap Devil,” which is a play on Eminem’s “Rap God.” Not one to let a song go unanswered, Slim Shady responded with his own diss track, “Killshot,” which pretty much ended the beef. According to Eminem, the only reason he was inflamed by MGK was that he kept calling him out. In a follow-up album, “Kamikaze,” Eminem also dissed a few other musicians as well.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=false>We’re not saying that Eminem won by producing his own, and arguably better, diss track, but that’s where the pair left it, other than Kelly’s occasional call out. Ultimately, it seems like Eminem was annoyed about the entire situation because it honestly seems like a smaller artist was attempting to inflate his own career by calling him out in public. There might not be much animosity between the pair in 2023, but there definitely was when their tracks were released back in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMnaZmpZGYtaq6xGaerqZdoLKtuNhmmKecXZq6qrrEpmShmaSaeqatwqFkqKyYmr9w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-install-tripp-trapp-baby-cushion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to install tripp trapp baby cushion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-grant-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Grant Net Worth: How Much Was Paul Grant Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./246919-diddy-poses-with-his-6-kids-trendy-festi-html.html>Diddy Poses With His 6 Kids in Trendy Festive Outfits See the Heart-Melting Family Photos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./apple-ios-5-review.html>iCloud: iOS 5 Integration and Store Updates</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-iddo-goldberg-wife-ashley-madekwe-everything-to-know-about-the-actor-208248-html.html>Who Is Iddo Goldberg Wife Ashley Madekwe?
